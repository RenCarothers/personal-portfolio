                  Greetings, I'm Ren (they/them), recent grad of Ada Developers Academy. I am a passionate coder, avid plant lover, and videogame nerd.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before I joined the tech world, I managed a small botanical supplement store for many years. From this experience, I gained a wealth of knowledge with business/inventory/employee management, and customer care. I decided to pursue a career as a junior dev because I have always had a passion for web development, although everything I initially knew was self-taught front end design work. As a youngster, I spent many hours making blog websites and tv show fansites. In my career, I have utilized my web skills in embellishing and streamlining employer websites, but I am eager to at last make this more than just a side project and personal interest. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am so excited to be a part of this rapidly changing industry that has such power to make a difference to communities around the world.
                </p>
                <p>I look forward to the opportunity to talk and meet with you!</p>
